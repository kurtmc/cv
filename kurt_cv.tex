\section{\centerline{PROJECTS}} 
\begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{C} \\ Developed a kernel module that can be dynamically loaded into the Linux kernel during run time. It uses a character device to take in a phrase as a string and return it reversed, i.e. "Hello World" becomes "World Hello". Link to project: \href{https://github.com/streetdragon/reverse\_module}{https://github.com/streetdragon/reverse\_module}.
        \item \textbf{C++} \\ Wrote an OpenGL application in C++ for a university project. The application rendered a simple robot which could be controlled using the keyboard to catch falling objects. The robot was rendered using a combination of transformed primitives (cubes and cylinders) and a revolved surface (for the net that catches object). The surface was rendered using a Hermite curve that was revolved around an axis, a texture map was applied to the surface so that it looked more like a net.
        \item \textbf{Java} \\ Developed an app that allows people to easily calculate how much income tax they will pay based on hourly income and hours worked, it uses tax tables published by New Zealand IRD. Link to app \href{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mcalpinedevelopment.calculatepay}{on Google Play}
        \item \textbf{Bash} \\ Developed a file renaming command line tool in bash. The tool detects a certain pattern in a group of filenames and applies a new pattern to rename the files for improved readability.
