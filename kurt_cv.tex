\section{Experience}
\subsection{Vocational}
\cventry{2014--2015}{Android Developer}{Vista Entertainment Solutions}{Auckland}{}{Currently working as a part time Android developer on a consumer application that allows customers
to buy tickets to see movies at their local cinema.\\
Link demo application: \url{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nz.co.vista.android.movie.abc}\\
My work on the Android application involves:
\begin{itemize}
\item collaborating with other developers, test analysts, business analysts and business people
\item using a bug tracker to find bugs relating to the application
\item using version control systems to get the latest source code from a centralized server, merging
changes into the main and release branches
\item fixing internal and customer visible bugs
\item implementing features designed by the business analyst on the team
\item having my work reviewed and quality tested
\item highly experienced using the following tools for android development:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item mockito - java testing framework
	\item gradle - build automation tool
	\item guice - lightweight dependency injection
	\item jenkins - continuous integration server
	\item otto bus - android specific event bus
	\item git - source control management
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}}
\cventry{2013--2014}{Student Intern}{Vista Entertainment Solutions}{Auckland}{}{
\begin{itemize}%
\item My role involved working on bugs in the cinema management software. The technologies used in that
area include WinForms, Visual Basic, C\#, .NET, and Microsoft SQL Server.
\item Some of my work included web development where I updated the user interface on a legacy website
that served pages using XSLT. Other technologies used were JavaScript, SASS, HTML, and ASP.NET.
\end{itemize}}

\section{Projects}
\cvitem{Java}{Developed a source to source compiler using JavaCC that took Java
8 style lambda expressions and generated valid Java 7 anonymous class
instantiations. The compiler also took care to check the semantics of how the
lambda expression were used and reported useful errors if it was used
incorrectly. Link to project:
\url{https://github.com/kurtmc/LambdaSourceToSource}}
\cvitem{C}{Developed a kernel module that can be dynamically loaded into the Linux kernel during run time.  It uses a
character device to take in a phrase as a string and return it reversed, i.e. ``Hello World'' becomes ``World Hello''.
Link to project: \url{https://github.com/kurtmc/reverse_module}}
\cvitem{Bash}{Developed a file renaming command line tool in bash. The tool detects a certain pattern in a group of
filenames and applies a new pattern to rename the files for improved readability. Link to project:
\url{https://github.com/kurtmc/renamer}}

This application is for \roleName{} advertised by \companyName{}. I was pointed
to this position by Brett McAlpine from the Development Centre in Onehunga.

I am currently completing a Software Engineering degree at the University of
Auckland. I am in my fourth and final year, and I will finish my studies in
November at which time I will be available to work full time. In the mean time I
am working part time, around 15 to 20 hours a week for a small company in
Freemans Bay under a very casual contract. So from now up until November I would
be available and very happy to join the NPD team and get up to speed with
product and development at \companyName{}.

I looking forward to meeting with you in the future to discuss this further.
