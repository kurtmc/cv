{\sl \textbf{Projects}}
\begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{C} Wrote a kernel module that can be dynamically loaded into the Linux kernel during run time. It uses a character device to take in a phrase as a string and return it reversed, i.e. "Hello World" becomes "World Hello". It's a trivial algorithm but since it is implemented in the kernel there are many restrictions to what you can do for example there is no easy way to do floating point arithmetic, the stack is fixed and all the code you write is asynchronous. This project demonstrates my understanding of low level C programming and understanding of fundamental kernel concepts. (link to project \href{https://github.com/streetdragon/reverse\_module}{https://github.com/streetdragon/reverse\_module}) 
        \item \textbf{C++} Wrote an OpenGL application in C++ for a university project. The application rendered a simple robot which could be controlled using the keyboard to catch falling objects. The robot was rendered using a combination of transformed primitives (cubes and cylinders) and a revolved surface (for the net that catches object). The surface was rendered using a Hermite curve that was revolved around an axis, a texture map was applied to the surface so that it looked more like a net.
        \item \textbf{Java} I currently work as an Android developer for Vista, I use the eclipse plugin at work to develop for Android. The application I work on for Vista is an app that allows users to purchase cinema tickets for movies from their mobile phone. It has many features that you would get if you purchases a movie ticket from the cinema website or physically at the cinema. Features include the ability to use your loyalty account (receive and redeem points when buying tickets) seat selection, filter cinemas by location and movie.
        \item \textbf{Bash} I have written a file renaming command line tool in bash. The tool detects a certain pattern in a group of files and applies a new pattern to rename the files to help you organize files on your computer. (link to project \href{https://github.com/streetdragon/renamer}{https://github.com/streetdragon/renamer})
        \item \textbf{HTML} I have some experience developing small web applications at Vista, I worked on an application at Vista that our clients used to manage loyalty members, points and rewards. Some of the technologies I used whilst working on that particular product was HTML5 for the front end, SASS to generate CSS to style the HTML, JavaScript for form validation, Microsoft T-SQL for query results and updating data. I even had to update some XSLT that was used to generate some of the web pages.
