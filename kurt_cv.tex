My work on the Android application involves:
\begin{itemize}
\item collaborating with other developers, test analysts, business analysts and business people
\item using a bug tracker to find bugs relating to the application
\item using version control systems to get the latest source code from a centralised server, merging
changes into the main and release branches

\item implementing features designed by the business analyst on the team
\item having my work reviewed and quality tested
\item highly experienced using the following tools for android development:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item mockito - java testing framework
	\item gradle - build automation tool
	\item guice - lightweight dependency injection
	\item jenkins - continuous integration server
	\item otto bus - android specific event bus
	\item git - source control management
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}}
\cventry{2013--2014}{Student Intern}{Vista Entertainment Solutions}{Auckland}{}{

\end{itemize}}

\section{Projects}
\cvitem{Java}{Developed a source to source compiler using JavaCC that took Java
8 style lambda expressions and generated valid Java 7 anonymous class
instantiations. The compiler also took care to check the semantics of how the
lambda expression were used and reported useful errors if it was used
incorrectly. Link to project:
\url{https://github.com/kurtmc/LambdaSourceToSource}}
\cvitem{C}{Developed a kernel module that can be dynamically loaded into the Linux kernel during run time.  It uses a
character device to take in a phrase as a string and return it reversed, i.e. ``Hello World'' becomes ``World Hello''.
Link to project: \url{https://github.com/kurtmc/reverse_module}}
\cvitem{C}{Developed a simple filesystem for the FUSE interface on linux using
C. It's simple filesystem that reads and writes to files in memory. Link to
project: \url{https://github.com/kurtmc/hello-world-fuse}}
\cvitem{Bash}{Developed a file renaming command line tool in bash. The tool detects a certain pattern in a group of
filenames and applies a new pattern to rename the files for improved readability. Link to project:
